        <p>My name is Kathy. I was born and raised in Los Angeles. I got my bachelors degree in Psychology from UCLA in 2016. I've been working as a legal assistant since then at a Plaintiffs Litigation Firm in Brentwood. I grew up spending a lot of time on the computer and was always interested in learning to code. After saving up some money, I decided to take the plunge and apply to a bootcamp. I decided on UCLA Extension because of my familiarity to the campus and the proximity to my work. I look forward to learning and challenging myself in this journey.</p>
